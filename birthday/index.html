          <p>Happy Birthday, Mother. I hope you've had an excellent day so far and continue to have good days for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>I'm not quite sure how much use you'll get out of having your own website, but I think it'll be reasonably useful and it's quite easy to maintain so it should hopefully not be too much of a hassle. Needless to say I'll help in transitioning all the domain information and website hosting to your accounts when you have time, but I think you shouldn't have too much trouble editing the website given the classes you took on HTML &amp CSS.</p>
          <p>Anyways, have a good rest of your birthday.:)</p>
